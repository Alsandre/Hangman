_Readme document was created later in development_
_Reason for that is: well, from the start I did try to orginize code and make it readable and since this is small project_
_I could not see need for additional documantation._
_However, since this project is part of the [Digital Academy](https://digitaledu.ge/javascript-kursi/)'s Javascript course_
_I made decision that time and money I am going to spend here should worth it :), so back to topic, I am trying to implement different methodologies_
_for a given task. E.g. first time I had to assign `class` I did it inside `HTML`,_
_then for the same kind of situation I used `document.querySellector()` method in combination with `element.classList.add()`_ 
_then `document.getElementById()` in combination with `element.className` attribute_
_Long story short, I think that soon the code will be unreadable, so I decide to try out readme file for some clarification and readability_

# `javascript` 
## _Lets start by clarifying section names and content in order_

>> 1. **Global variables** - _variables used throught script_
>> 2. **Game UI** - _Game's User Interfaces_
>> 3. **Logic** - _Game and Interaction logic_
>> 4. **MISC** - _Additions, interesting features_

# `CSS`
## _At the moment I think CSS file doesnt have final look_

>> 1. **Reset** - _Very basic 'reset'_
>> 2. **General** - _Not game specific adjastments_
>> 3. **Settings UI** - _Landing page User Interface_
>> 4. **Game UI** - _In Game User interface_

### **_Here I will try to describe the Game experience:_**
_The Landing page gives two options to start game and to_
_and to select category of words collection_

_As we engage game by hitting **START** button we are_
_brought to game interface_

_we get keyboard for isnerting words_
_and empty slots as a hint for word's 'Char' count and places_

_Rules describe that player is given seven chances_
_across all words meaning if player guesses wrong_
_(does not matter consequent or not) eighth time... well, Hangman!_
